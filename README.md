# Moroccan-Football-Players-Recognition

This repository contains the source code for a Moroccan football players recognition app, developed using machine learning and deep learning techniques. The app utilizes Local Binary Patterns (LBP) feature extraction with machine learning algorithm, and another file using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for player recognition.

## Features

- **Recognition of Moroccan Football Players:** The app is specifically designed to recognize Moroccan football players from images.
- **Machine Learning with LBP Features Extraction:** Local Binary Patterns (LBP) are utilized for feature extraction from images, enabling effective pattern recognition.
- **Deep Learning with CNN:** Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are employed for deep learning-based recognition, enhancing accuracy and robustness.

## Usage

1. **Upload Image:** Upload an image containing a Moroccan football player.
2. **Recognition:** The app will process the image using both LBP feature extraction and CNN-based recognition.
3. **Display Results:** The recognized player along with confidence scores will be displayed to the user.
